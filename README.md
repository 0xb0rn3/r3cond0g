---

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **Automated Setup (Recommended)**

Our intelligent runner scripts handle everything from dependency management to compilation and execution. These cross-platform automation tools ensure a seamless setup experience regardless of your operating system.

#### **Linux & macOS Setup**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/0xb0rn3/r3cond0g.git
cd r3cond0g

# Execute the automated setup
chmod +x run && ./run
```

#### **Windows Setup (PowerShell)**

For Windows users, we provide two convenient deployment methods:

**One-Line Remote Execution** (Fastest Method):
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xb0rn3/r3cond0g/main/run.ps1 | iex
```

**Local Clone and Execute**:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/0xb0rn3/r3cond0g.git
cd r3cond0g
.\run.ps1
```

The PowerShell runner script represents a sophisticated automation solution that transforms the installation experience on Windows systems. This isn't just a simple build script‚Äîit's an intelligent environment management system that handles complex dependency resolution, version control, and deployment workflows.

### **Enhanced Windows Runner Features**

The PowerShell automation script (`run.ps1`) incorporates enterprise-grade features designed for professional security environments:

**Intelligent Dependency Resolution**: The script automatically detects missing dependencies (Git and Go) and attempts installation through multiple package managers. It first tries Windows Package Manager (winget) for modern Windows 10/11 systems, then falls back to Chocolatey if available. This multi-layered approach ensures maximum compatibility across different Windows configurations.

**Smart Update Management**: Rather than forcing users to manually check for updates, the runner implements a time-based update checking system. It maintains a timestamp file (`.last_update_check`) and only queries the remote repository when the configured interval has elapsed. This reduces unnecessary network traffic while ensuring users stay current with security patches and feature updates.

**Advanced Compilation Intelligence**: The script doesn't blindly recompile the binary every time. Instead, it performs file modification time comparisons between source files (`*.go`, `go.mod`, `go.sum`) and the existing executable. This means faster startup times for users who haven't modified the codebase, while ensuring that any changes are properly compiled.

**Professional User Experience**: The script provides rich, color-coded console output with progress indicators, status messages, and clear error reporting. Each operation category (INFO, SUCCESS, ERROR, WARNING, UPDATE) uses distinct visual styling to help users quickly understand what's happening during the setup process.

### **Runner Command Reference**

Both platform runners support identical command-line options for consistent cross-platform workflows:

```bash
# Linux/macOS Options
./run --help                    # Display comprehensive help information
./run --force-update-check      # Bypass time interval and check for updates immediately
./run --skip-update-check       # Skip update verification for this execution
./run --rebuild                 # Force complete recompilation regardless of file timestamps

# Windows PowerShell Options (Identical Functionality)
.\run.ps1 -Help                 # Display comprehensive help information
.\run.ps1 -ForceUpdateCheck     # Bypass time interval and check for updates immediately
.\run.ps1 -SkipUpdateCheck      # Skip update verification for this execution
.\run.ps1 -Rebuild              # Force complete recompilation regardless of file timestamps
```

The consistency between platforms means that security teams can develop standardized deployment procedures that work identically across heterogeneous environments. Whether you're deploying on a Linux penetration testing distribution, a macOS development machine, or a Windows security workstation, the command syntax and behavior remain constant.

### **Understanding the Automation Workflow**

When you execute either runner script, it performs a sophisticated multi-stage workflow designed to ensure reliable, repeatable deployments:

**Stage 1: Environment Validation**: The script first checks for required system dependencies. On Windows, this includes testing for Git and Go installations, and if they're missing, attempting automatic installation through system package managers. The script intelligently handles PATH environment variable updates and can even refresh the current session's environment without requiring a system restart.

**Stage 2: Repository Management**: If you're using the one-line remote execution method, the script automatically clones the repository to your local system. For local executions, it validates that you're in the correct directory structure and that essential files like `main.go` and `go.mod` are present.

**Stage 3: Update Intelligence**: Unless explicitly skipped, the script performs git-based update checking by comparing local and remote commit hashes. If updates are available, it presents a clear prompt asking whether to apply them. The update process includes automatic script restart functionality, ensuring that any improvements to the runner itself are immediately available.

**Stage 4: Go Module Management**: The script initializes Go modules if necessary and runs `go mod tidy` to ensure all dependencies are properly resolved. It even includes proactive dependency management, pre-fetching common packages that might be required during compilation.

**Stage 5: Intelligent Compilation**: Before compiling, the script analyzes file modification timestamps to determine if recompilation is actually necessary. When compilation does occur, it uses optimization flags (`-ldflags="-s -w"`) to produce smaller, more efficient binaries by stripping symbol tables and debug information.

**Stage 6: Execution Handoff**: Finally, the script launches the compiled RECONRAPTOR binary, passing through any command-line arguments you provided to the runner itself.

### **Manual Installation**

For users who prefer granular control over the installation process or are working in environments where automated scripts aren't permitted:

```bash
# Verify Go installation and version compatibility
go version  # Should show Go 1.18 or higher

# Clone the repository and navigate to project directory
git clone https://github.com/0xb0rn3/r3cond0g.git
cd r3cond0g

# Initialize Go module (if not already present)
go mod init r3cond0g

# Download and organize dependencies
go mod tidy

# Compile with optimization flags for production use
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o r3cond0g main.go

# For Windows users, compile to executable
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o r3cond0g.exe main.go

# Launch RECONRAPTOR
./r3cond0g        # Linux/macOS
.\r3cond0g.exe    # Windows
```

The manual installation process gives you complete visibility into each step and allows for customization of build flags, output locations, and dependency management. This approach is particularly valuable for security-conscious environments where automated scripts must be reviewed before execution.

## üîß **Configuration & Setup**

### **NVD API Integration**

The National Vulnerability Database integration transforms RECONRAPTOR from a simple port scanner into a comprehensive vulnerability assessment platform. Here's how to properly configure and utilize this powerful feature:

**Obtaining Your API Key**: Visit the [National Vulnerability Database API Request Page](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key) and submit a request for a free API key. The process typically takes 24-48 hours for approval, and the key provides access to the most current vulnerability data available.

**Configuration Methods**:

**Environment Variable Approach** (Recommended for Security):
```bash
# Linux/macOS
export NVD_API_KEY="your-nvd-api-key-here"
./r3cond0g -vuln

# Windows PowerShell
$env:NVD_API_KEY="your-nvd-api-key-here"
.\r3cond0g.exe -vuln

# Windows Command Prompt
set NVD_API_KEY=your-nvd-api-key-here
r3cond0g.exe -vuln
```

**Command Line Parameter**:
```bash
./r3cond0g -nvd-key "your-nvd-api-key-here" -vuln -target 192.168.1.0/24
```

**Interactive Configuration**:
```bash
./r3cond0g
# Select option 2: Configure Scan Parameters
# Follow prompts to enter and save your API key
```

The environment variable approach is recommended for security reasons because it prevents your API key from appearing in command history or process lists visible to other users on shared systems.

### **Custom CVE Database Integration**

For organizations with private vulnerability databases or specialized threat intelligence, RECONRAPTOR supports custom CVE data integration through JSON formatting:

  "Tomcat 9.0.45": ["CVE-2021-25122", "CVE-2021-25329"]
}
```

To integrate custom vulnerability data:
```bash
./r3cond0g -cve-plugin custom_vulnerabilities.json -target example.com
```

This feature is particularly valuable for organizations that maintain internal vulnerability databases, use commercial threat intelligence feeds, or need to incorporate zero-day vulnerability information that hasn't yet been published to public databases.

### **Performance Optimization Guidelines**

RECONRAPTOR's performance can be fine-tuned based on your specific scanning environment and requirements:

**Network-Constrained Environments**:
```bash
# Reduce concurrency and increase timeout for unstable networks
./r3cond0g -target 10.0.0.0/16 -concurrency 25 -timeout 8000
```

**High-Performance Scanning**:
```bash
# Maximize speed on stable, high-bandwidth networks
./r3cond0g -target 192.168.1.0/24 -concurrency 500 -timeout 2000
```

**Stealth Scanning**:
```bash
# Minimize network footprint for covert reconnaissance
./r3cond0g -target example.com -concurrency 5 -timeout 15000 -ports 80,443,22
```

Understanding these optimization parameters helps you balance scanning speed, network impact, and detection avoidance based on your specific assessment requirements and constraints.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Compliance**

### **Ethical Usage Framework**

RECONRAPTOR is engineered exclusively for authorized security testing and educational purposes. The tool's capabilities require responsible usage within appropriate legal and ethical boundaries:

**Legal Authorization Requirements**: Before conducting any network reconnaissance, users must obtain explicit written authorization from network owners. This includes corporate environments, cloud infrastructures, and any systems not directly owned or controlled by the user. Unauthorized network scanning may constitute criminal activity under various jurisdictions' computer crime laws.

**Professional Engagement Scope**: Use RECONRAPTOR only within the defined scope of authorized penetration testing engagements, security assessments, vulnerability research, or approved educational activities. Document all scanning activities and maintain detailed logs for compliance and audit purposes.

**Responsible Disclosure Practices**: When vulnerabilities are discovered during authorized testing, follow established responsible disclosure protocols. Coordinate with system owners to ensure vulnerabilities are properly reported, tracked, and remediated before any public disclosure.

### **Compliance Integration**

Organizations deploying RECONRAPTOR should ensure alignment with relevant security frameworks and regulatory requirements:

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework Alignment**: RECONRAPTOR supports the "Identify" function by helping organizations understand their network assets and vulnerabilities. Use scan results to populate asset inventories, risk assessments, and security control effectiveness evaluations.

**ISO 27001 Documentation**: Scan results can contribute to information security management system (ISMS) documentation, particularly for asset management (A.8), vulnerability management (A.12.6), and security testing (A.14.2) controls.

**Industry-Specific Regulations**: For organizations subject to PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOX, or other regulatory requirements, RECONRAPTOR scanning should be integrated into regular security assessment programs with appropriate documentation and evidence retention.

### **Operational Security Considerations**

**Network Impact Management**: Configure scanning parameters to minimize disruption to production systems. Use appropriate concurrency limits, timeout values, and scanning schedules to avoid overwhelming target systems or triggering security alerting systems.

**Data Protection**: Scan results may contain sensitive information about network architecture, system vulnerabilities, and security controls. Implement appropriate data protection measures including encryption at rest, secure transmission, and access controls for scan result files.

**Audit Trail Maintenance**: Maintain comprehensive logs of all scanning activities including targets, parameters, execution times, and personnel involved. This documentation supports compliance requirements and incident response activities.

---

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Installation and Setup Issues**

**Dependency Resolution Problems**:

If the automated runner scripts fail to install Git or Go, you may need to address underlying system issues:

**Windows Specific**: Ensure you have administrative privileges or access to package managers. If winget is not available on older Windows versions, manually install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and Go from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/). After manual installation, restart your PowerShell session to refresh environment variables.

**Linux/macOS Specific**: Verify your system's package manager is functioning correctly. For systems behind corporate firewalls, you may need to configure proxy settings for package managers and Git operations.

**Go Module Dependency Issues**: If `go mod tidy` fails with network errors, this often indicates connectivity issues or corporate firewall restrictions blocking access to Go module repositories. Configure Go proxy settings or work with your network administrator to allow access to `proxy.golang.org`.

### **Performance Optimization**

**High CPU or Memory Usage**: RECONRAPTOR's multi-threaded architecture can consume significant system resources during intensive scans. Monitor system performance and adjust the `-concurrency` parameter based on available resources:

```bash
# Reduce resource usage for lighter systems
./r3cond0g -target 192.168.1.0/24 -concurrency 25

# Optimize for systems with abundant resources
./r3cond0g -target 10.0.0.0/16 -concurrency 100
```

**Network Performance Issues**: Slow network responses or timeouts can significantly impact scanning performance. Adjust timeout values based on network characteristics:

```bash
# Increase timeout for high-latency networks
./r3cond0g -target remote-target.com -timeout 10000

# Decrease timeout for local network scanning
./r3cond0g -target 192.168.1.0/24 -timeout 2000
```

**Rate Limiting and API Issues**: When using NVD API integration, you may encounter rate limiting or quota exhaustion. The NVD API allows different request rates based on whether you're using an API key:

```bash
# Monitor API usage and implement delays if necessary
./r3cond0g -vuln -nvd-key YOUR-KEY -target single-host.com  # Start with smaller scans
```

### **Common Error Scenarios**

**"Permission Denied" Errors**: On Unix-like systems, ensure the compiled binary has execute permissions:
```bash
chmod +x r3cond0g
```

**"Port Already in Use" Messages**: Some scanning operations may conflict with existing services. This is normal and indicates the target port is actively used by another service.

**"Connection Refused" Results**: These results indicate that the target port is closed or filtered by a firewall. This is valuable reconnaissance information, not an error condition.

**Compilation Errors**: If Go compilation fails, verify you have Go 1.18 or higher installed and that all source files are present and uncorrupted:
```bash
go version                    # Verify Go installation
go mod verify                 # Check module integrity
go clean -cache               # Clear build cache if necessary
```
