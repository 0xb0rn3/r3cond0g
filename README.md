## üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Compliance**

### **Ethical Usage Guidelines**

RECONRAPTOR is designed exclusively for authorized security testing and educational purposes. Users must understand and accept the following responsibilities:

**Legal Authorization**: Always obtain explicit written permission before scanning networks or systems you do not own. Unauthorized network scanning may violate local, national, or international laws.

**Professional Standards**: Use RECONRAPTOR only within the scope of authorized penetration testing engagements, security assessments, or educational environments.

**Responsible Disclosure**: When vulnerabilities are discovered during authorized testing, follow responsible disclosure practices and coordinate with system owners.

### **Compliance Considerations**

Organizations using RECONRAPTOR should ensure alignment with relevant frameworks such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, and industry-specific regulations. Maintain proper documentation of authorized testing activities and results.

**Installation Problems**:
- Verify Go version compatibility (1.18+ required): `go version`
- Ensure Git is installed and accessible: `git --version`
- Check network connectivity for dependency downloads

**Performance Optimization**:
- Reduce concurrency for unstable networks: `-concurrency 50`
- Increase timeout for slow targets: `-timeout 10000`
- Focus on specific port ranges rather than full scans for initial reconnaissance

**API Integration Issues**:
- Verify NVD API key validity and quota limits
- Check internet connectivity for NVD API access
- Monitor rate limiting messages and adjust scan timing accordingly
